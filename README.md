## A5 -  Explanations

This repository presents the outcome of a collaboration to solve assignment A5 given by the module ["Human Centered Data Science"](https://github.com/FUB-HCC/hcds-winter-2020) of the FU Berlin in winter semester 2020/21. The assignment is part of **Exercise 07 - Explanations** and described **[here on the module's homepage]**(https://github.com/FUB-HCC/hcds-winter-2020/wiki/07_exercise).


_(changes to the following text may be necessary as it is written before any work has been done, so anything after this paragraph may not be correct as long as this text is shown._ **Reminder to ourselves:** _Check this text in due time)_

The assignment will be delivered as a Jupyter Notebook, complemented by a blog written in markdown. Any webbrowser should be good enough to properly show both, however, to actually use Jupyter as intended (i.e., to run any code) some work may be needed, such as using a special site or installing some software.

The fundament for Jupyter as we used it is Python3. Please refer to the homepage of the module (see above) or to the homepage of Jupyter, like [the documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Cheers.
